## Hi, I’m Mahmoud (aka **falcon0x1**) 👋

I’m a **penetration tester in continuous learning**, focused on **Web, API, and Android security**.

This blog is where I share what I learn **while studying, practicing, and testing**.  
Some posts represent solid conclusions, while others are learning notes written during the process — both are intentional.

Writing helps me understand security topics more deeply, and sharing them helps others who are learning along the same path.

## What This Blog Is About

Here you’ll find:
- Notes from labs, courses, and hands-on practice
- Android and API attack surface exploration
- Traffic interception and security misconfigurations
- Logic flaws explained through real, reproducible examples

This is not a theory-only blog.  
Everything here comes from **doing**, not just reading.

## How I Use This Blog

I use this blog to:
- Turn study sessions into clear, structured notes
- Document progress and revisit concepts later
- Practice explaining security topics simply
- Build a personal knowledge base I can rely on

If something improves or changes later, I update it. Learning evolves.

## My Learning Rule

> Learn → Test → Break → Document → Repeat

If I can reproduce an issue and explain *why* it happens, I consider it learned.
